This was my university advanced econometrics project, where I analysed the US unemployment rate and the the amount of non-farm job openings in the US. Each time series has a monthly frequency and over 120 observations. The USA unemployment rate series starts from December 1948 and ends in February 2020. The USA non-farm job openings series measures the amount of open jobs available in the market, excluding jobs open for farm workers, private household employees or those working for non-profit organizations. The series started in December 2000 and ended in December 2019.

The project tested for unit roots (stationarity), cointergration, granger casuality, statistical significance and also produced a set of ARDL, VAR and ARIMA models the later of which produced forecasts for both the unemployment rate and the job openings rate for the next ten months following the end of each series respectively. 

The code found in the "Unemployment - Job Opening R Code [HadleyN].R" file is all adapted from a set of code provided to us by the lecturer of the course. All credit for the inital creation of the code goes to the lecturer.
